# cpuworker

## Status

Working in process.

## Run the Demo

Make sure the GOMAXPROCS is bigger than 1 and there is at least `GOMAXPROCS` physical OS threads available.

Run the example/demo.go.

```bash
# feel free to tune the parameters below if you like

# cmd 1
while true; do sleep 1;ab -s10000000 -c 10 -n 60 http://127.0.0.1:8080/delay1ms; done

# cmd 2
while true; do sleep 1;ab -s10000000 -c 10 -n 60 http://127.0.0.1:8080/checksumWithoutCpuWorker; done

# cmd 3
while true; do sleep 1;ab -s10000000 -c 10 -n 60 http://127.0.0.1:8080/checksumWithCpuWorker; done
```

Step 1: Killall already existing cmd `x`, then run the cmd 1.

Step 2: Killall already existing cmd `x`, then run the cmd 1 and cmd 2 simultaneously.

Step 3: Killall already existing cmd `x`, then run the cmd 1 and cmd 3 simultaneously.

Please watch the latency which cmd 1 yields carefully at every step and then you would catch the difference :-D

## Test Result On AWS

The server example/demo.go is running at an aws instance `c5d.12xlarge` and with the env `GOMAXPROCS` set to 16.

```bash
$ GOMAXPROCS=16 ./cpuworker-demo

GOMAXPROCS: 16 cpuWorkerMaxP: 12 length of crc32 bs: 262144
```

The benchmark tool is running at an aws instance `c5d.4xlarge`. The two machine is running at a same cluster placement group.

```bash
# please complete the server IP
SeverIP=x.x.x.x

# cmd 1
while true; do sleep 1;ab -s10000000 -c 100 -n 60000 http://$SeverIP:8080/delay1ms; done

# cmd 2
while true; do sleep 1;ab -s10000000 -c 100 -n 100000 http://$SeverIP:8080/checksumWithoutCpuWorker; done

# cmd 3
while true; do sleep 1;ab -s10000000 -c 100 -n 100000 http://$SeverIP:8080/checksumWithCpuWorker; done
```

Step 1: Killall already existing cmd `x`, then run the cmd 1 (run the standalone benchmark of delay1ms).

```bash
$ ab -s10000000 -c 100 -n 60000 http://$SeverIP:8080/delay1ms

Curent CPU load of the server side (and please note that the load average is already reaching the `GOMAXPROCS`, i.e. 16 in this case):
