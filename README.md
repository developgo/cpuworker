## Status

Working in process.

## Demo

Make sure the GOMAXPROCS is bigger than 1 and there is at least `GOMAXPROCS` physical OS threads available.

Run the example/demo.go.

```bash
# cmd 1
while true; do sleep 1;ab -s10000000 -c 10 -n 60 http://127.0.0.1:8080/delay1ms; done

# cmd 2
while true; do sleep 1;ab -s10000000 -c 10 -n 60 http://127.0.0.1:8080/checksumWithoutCpuWorker; done

# cmd 3
while true; do sleep 1;ab -s10000000 -c 10 -n 60 http://127.0.0.1:8080/checksumWithCpuWorker; done
```

Step 1: Killall already existing cmd `x`, then run the cmd 1.

Step 2: Killall already existing cmd `x`, then run the cmd 1 and cmd 2 simultaneously.

Step 3: Killall already existing cmd `x`, then run the cmd 1 and cmd 3 simultaneously.

Please watch the latency which cmd 1 yields carefully at every step and then you would catch the difference :-D
